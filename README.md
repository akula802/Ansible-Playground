This repo contains Ansible playbooks and other related items that I use in my homelab. Some of these are for the purpose of learning Ansible for the RHCE exam, and others are for general admin tasks.

Documentation of the entire Ansible ecosystem is not included (e.g. the hosts file, ansible.cfg, etc.). This is just for playbooks and scripts that I may reference later on other projects.

Select portions of my initial lab setup are loosely documented at https://www.gridnorth.tech/blog
